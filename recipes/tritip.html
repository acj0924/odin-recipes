    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, 
            and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place tri-tip in a glass baking dish and coat on all sides with spice 
            mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard 
            in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake until ingredients are blended.</li>
        <li>Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator. Let sit uncovered at room 
            temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; lightly oil the grates.</li>
        <li>Place tri-tip on the preheated grill and brush with vinegar mixture. Cook for 4 minutes, 
            flip, and baste. Flip and baste every 4 minutes until tri-tip starts to firm up and is 
            reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at 
            least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
